# Intuition
When solving the problem of generating Pascal's Triangle, the first thought is to leverage the inherent properties of the triangle. Each row is constructed based on the values of the previous row, where each element is the sum of the two elements directly above it from the previous row. The first and last elements of each row are always 1.

# Approach
1. Start with the base cases:
   - The first row is always `[1]`.
   - The second row is `[1, 1]`.
2. For subsequent rows, iterate and construct each row based on the previous row:
   - Initialize the row with a leading `1`.
   - Each inner element of the row is the sum of the two elements directly above it from the previous row.
   - End the row with a trailing `1`.
3. Continue this process until the desired number of rows is generated.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:  
  The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) because for each of the \(n\) rows, we perform an operation that is proportional to the number of rows.

- Space complexity:  
  The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) as we store the entire Pascal's Triangle up to the \(n\)-th row.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def generate(self, numRows: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        if numRows == 0:
            return []
        elif numRows == 1:
            return [[1]]
        
        # Initialize Pascal's triangle with the first two rows
        t = [[1], [1, 1]]

        # Generate each row from the third row onward
        for i in range(2, numRows):
            row = [1]  # Start with 1
            for j in range(1, len(t[i-1])):
                row.append(t[i-1][j-1] + t[i-1][j])
            row.append(1)  # End with 1
            t.append(row)
        
        return t[:numRows]
```

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
When encountering a zero in a matrix, the entire row and column containing that zero should be set to zero. To avoid altering the matrix while iterating through it, marking cells that need to be zeroed with a temporary marker (such as 'ig') can be useful. This way, we can make a second pass through the matrix to finalize the zeroing process.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Iterate through the matrix to find cells containing zero.
2. For each zero cell, mark the corresponding row and column cells with a temporary marker ('ig'), except for cells that are already zero.
3. Make a second pass through the matrix to convert all marked cells ('ig') to zero.
4. The solution modifies the matrix in place as required.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
  The time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns. This is because we iterate over each element in the matrix twice (once for marking and once for converting).

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
  The space complexity is \(O(1)\), as we do not use any extra space that scales with the input size, aside from a few variables.

        def mark_row(matrix, row):
            for i in range(len(matrix[row])):
                if matrix[row][i] != 0:
                    matrix[row][i] = 'ig'
        
        def mark_col(matrix, col):
            for i in range(len(matrix)):

                    matrix[i][col] = 'ig'
        
        rows = len(matrix)
        cols = len(matrix[0])
        
        # First pass: mark the rows and columns
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    mark_row(matrix, i)
                    mark_col(matrix, j)
        
        # Second pass: set marked cells to zero
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if matrix[i][j] == 'ig':
                    matrix[i][j] = 0
